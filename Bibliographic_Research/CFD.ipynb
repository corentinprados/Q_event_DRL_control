    "Meshing, in the context of computational simulations, refers to the process of dividing a geometric domain into discrete elements (usually triangles or quadrilaterals in 2D, and tetrahedra or hexahedra in 3D) called \"mesh elements\" or \"finite elements\". This process is essential for conducting numerical simulations using techniques such as finite element analysis (FEA) and other numerical methods.\n",
