    "### What is Reynolds Stress ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reynolds stress ($\\tau_{ij}$) is a fundamental concept in fluid mechanics, particularly in the study of turbulent flows. It represents the statistical average of the fluctuating component of the momentum transport caused by turbulent velocity fluctuations within a fluid flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress is the average stress caused by fluctuations in velocity in a turbulent flow. It arises due to the interaction between turbulent eddies of different sizes, leading to variations in momentum transfer within the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reynolds Decomposition:**\n",
    "The Reynolds decomposition separates the velocity field into its mean ($\\overline{u_i}$) and fluctuating ($u_i'$) components:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_i = \\overline{u_i} + u_i'\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis for Writing Reynolds Stress:**\n",
    "- The Reynolds decomposition assumes that the flow variables can be decomposed into a mean part and a fluctuating part.\n",
    "- The Reynolds stress tensor $\\tau_{ij}$ is defined as the average of the product of the fluctuating velocities $u_i'$ and $u_j'$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau_{ij} = \\overline{u_i' u_j'}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress has both normal and shear stress components, representing momentum transfer in different directions within the flow. \n",
    "- The normal stress components represent momentum transfer perpendicular to the flow direction.\n",
    "- The shear stress components represent momentum transfer parallel to the flow direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress is crucial for understanding turbulence dynamics and predicting turbulent flow behavior in various engineering and scientific applications. It influences the overall momentum transfer, heat transfer, and mixing processes within turbulent flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress can be measured experimentally using various techniques such as hot-wire anemometry, particle image velocimetry (PIV), and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). These experimental methods allow researchers to quantify the magnitude and distribution of Reynolds stress in turbulent flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling:**\n",
    "In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, Reynolds stress is often modeled using turbulence models such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations or large eddy simulation (LES) models. These models aim to predict the behavior of turbulent flows by simulating the statistical characteristics of Reynolds stress.\n"

    "## History of the statistical properties of the Reynolds stresses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beginning p. 101\n",
    "The study of the statistical properties of the Reynolds stresses began in the late 1960s, with the observation by Kline et al. (1967) that the near-wall low-velocity streaks undergo a process of lift-up, oscillation, break-up and ejection, which they called bursting. Kim, Kline & Reynolds (1971) showed that most of the turbulence production in the near-wall region occurs during those bursts, and several conditional- sampling techniques were developed to identify the structures involved in the process. Examples are the u-level detection of Lu & Willmarth (1973), the VITA (variable- interval time average) of Blackwelder & Kaplan (1976) and the VISA (variable- interval space average) of Kim (1985). Several of those techniques were surveyed by Bogard & Tiederman (1986), who concluded that the best compromise between detection probability and false positives was provided by the quadrant analysis of Wallace, Eckelman & Brodkey (1972), Willmarth & Lu (1972) and Lu & Willmarth (1973), in which points of the flow are classified in terms of the quadrant of the parameter plane of streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations. Q1 events (outward interactions) have u > 0 and v > 0, Q2 events (ejections) have u < 0 and v > 0, Q3 events (inward interactions) have u < 0 and v < 0 and Q4 events (sweeps) have u > 0 and v < 0. Hereafter, Q events will be referred to simply as Qs, and we will occasionally group the ‘gradient’ Q2s and Q4s as Q−, and the ‘counter-gradient’ Q1s and Q3s as Q+.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After p. 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Although most of the early work focused on bursting in the buffer region, studies during the 1990s began to establish a relationship between near-wall bursting and outer structures. Antonia, Bisset & Browne (1990) applied a variant of the u-level method (WAG, window average gradient) to boundary layers with relatively high Reynolds numbers based on the momentum thickness, Reθ = U∞θ/ν = 1360–9630, corresponding to h+ = 530–3100. They reported that outer-scale discontinuities in the streamwise velocity, extending across the whole thickness of the boundary layer, tend to be located near the upstream end of the near-wall bursts. Wark & Nagib (1991) applied quadrant analysis to a boundary layer at Reθ = 4650 (h+ = 1500), and found large conditional events with sizes of the order of h. Using a related identification technique in the atmospheric boundary layer, Narasimha et al. (2007) described Reynolds-stress structures with lengths comparable to the distance to the wall that, because of the high Reynolds number involved, were both very long in wall units and very short compared with the boundary layer thickness. Hoyas & Jime ́nez (2006) showed that the spectral signatures of the very-large motions (Jime ́nez 1998; Kim&Adrian1999),orglobalmodes(delA ́lamoetal.2004),characteristicofthe outer region are present at the wall, as well as those of similar smaller structures in the logarithmic layer, and Hutchins & Marusic (2007b) showed that part of that influence is a modulation of the intensity of the small-scale buffer-layer fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recntly p. 102\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, Flores & Jime ́nez (2010a) showed that the hierarchy of structures of increasing sizes postulated by Townsend (1961) for the logarithmic layer can be represented numerically in computational boxes of widths proportional to the height to be studied. Each box contains a single complex structure, including a segment of a streamwise velocity streak and a cluster of vortices, that bursts quasiperiodically to fill the box with essentially normal turbulence, with a strong Q2 and Q4 occurring simultaneously. The existence of a hierarchy of Q2s and Q4s was also conjectured by Wark & Nagib (1991), and is consistent with the similarity observed by Kailas & Narasimha (1994) between the conditionally sampled structures extracted from the near-wall region of laboratory boundary layers and those in the logarithmic region of the atmospheric boundary layer.\n",
    "Q2s and Q4s play important roles in most of the structural models proposed to explain how turbulent kinetic energy and momentum are redistributed in wall-bounded turbulence. The majority of these models (see the review by Robinson 1991) are loosely based on the attached-eddy hypothesis of Townsend (1961) and involve wall- attached vortical loops growing from the wall into the outer region (Perry, Henbest & Chong 1986). More recently, in order to account for the very large-scale motions mentioned above, as well as for earlier experimental evidence on the internal structure of the bursts (Bogard & Tiederman 1986), a variant model has evolved to include vortex packets (Adrian, Meinhart & Tomkins 2000), in which trains of hairpin vortices grow from the wall by a process of merging (Tomkins & Adrian 2003) and self- regeneration (Zhou et al. 1999). The heads of the hairpins are arranged into inclined shear layers generated by the combined induction of the hairpins of the packet, with a Q4 upstream and above the packet and a Q2 beneath it. Ganapathisubramani, Longmire & Marusic (2003) used PIV data on wall-parallel planes in a boundary layer with Reθ = 2500 (h+ = 1060) to quantify the contribution to the Reynolds stresses by packets of hairpins. They report that, at y+ = 100, packets covering 4 % of the area produce 28 % of the total Reynolds stresses.\n",
    "The hairpin-packet model is usually understood to involve relatively smooth vortex loops as the structures associated with Townsend’s (1976) attached eddies, although recent discussions tend to include ‘canes, heads, legs and three-quarter hairpin shapes, generally asymmetric and distorted’ into the class of ‘hairpin-like’ vortices (Dennis & Nickels 2011a), making them hard to distinguish from generic vortices. An alternative,lessorganized,structurewasproposedbydelA ́lamoetal.(2006),who analysed the statistical properties of clusters of vortices (clusters hereafter) in direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of turbulent channels with h+ = 550–1880. The clusters segregate into wall-attached and wall-detached families. The wall-detached clusters are dissipative objects, with sizes that scale with the local Kolmogorov scale. The attached ones form a self-similar family of objects that mark strong Q2s. The averaged flow conditioned to an attached cluster consist on an elongated low-velocity streak extending downstream of the cluster, flanked by a pair of shorter high-velocity streaks. While this averaged structure is consistent with the hairpin packet paradigm, del A ́lamoetal.(2006)pointedoutthattheinstantaneousclustersaremorecomplex,in agreement with earlier visualizations by Tanahashi et al. (2004).\n",

    "An exctractor is an other word for describing the Q-events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Percolation Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Percolation analysis involves ploting the detection rate of extractors as a function of the parameter $H$, with the aim of maximizing this rate as in the following figure.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the threshold in (2.1) depends on the wall distance. As noted by Nagasoa & Handler (2003), using an identification method with a constant threshold, such as |τ| > Hu′(y0)v′(y0), with some reference y0, is problematic in inhomogeneous flows. In our case, very few objects are recovered in the outer region if y0 is chosen in the buffer layer, while choosing a high y0 results in a confusingly cluttered buffer layer. This behaviour agrees with the observations of Blackburn, Mansour & Cantwell (1996) and worsens as Re increases. Our choice of the local standard deviation in (2.1) results in a roughly constant ́contribution of the Qs to the Reynolds stress and agrees with a similar choice in del Alamo et al. (2006) for the identification of vortex clusters.\n",
    "As argued by Bogard & Tiederman (1986), quadrant analysis depends on the value of the hyperbolic-hole size H. They report that the optimum threshold for the buffer region is H ≈ 1, based on direct comparisons between the detected events and instantaneous visualizations of the flow. We choose H based on the percolation behaviour of (2.1). Percolation theory describes the statistics of the connected components of a random graph. Here, it is applied to the variation with H of the volume of the connected objects extracted by (2.1), as first used to identify vorticity and dissipation structures in isotropic turbulence by Moisy & Jime ́nez (2004) and in channelsbydelA ́lamoetal.(2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1(a) shows the percolation diagram of (2.1) in the two channels considered here. The solid lines are the ratio of the volume of the largest identified object, Vlar, to the total volume Vtot satisfying (2.1), and the dashed ones are the total number of identified objects, N/Nmax , normalized with its maximum over H. When H & 3, the identification only yields a few small objects that correspond to the strongest Qs. Decreasing H introduces new Qs, while previously identified ones grow in size. At first, the size of the largest Q changes little, and Vlar/Vtot stays roughly constant, but eventually the objects start to merge, resulting in a rapid increase of Vlar /Vtot and in a decrease of the number of objects. Figure 1(a) shows that this percolation crisis takes place in the range 0.5 . H . 3, independently of the Reynolds number. For lower thresholds, Vlar /Vtot ≈ 1, and most of the volume satisfying (2.1) belongs to a single object."

    "## Part 3 of the paper \n",
    "Part 3 of the paper \"The minimal flow unit in near-wall turbulence\" by Javier Jimenez and Parviz Moin focuses on the minimization of the computational box and the statistical properties of the flow within it. The authors explored various Reynolds numbers (2000, 3000, and 5000) to identify the smallest computational box that could sustain turbulence. This box is characterized by its ability to maintain non-laminar, stochastic, and three-dimensional flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key findings include:\n",
    "- **Minimal Domain Scaling**: The critical channel span, when expressed in wall units ($\\lambda_z^+$), is found to be roughly constant across different Reynolds numbers, with a critical value around 100. This aligns with experimental measurements of mean streak spacing in the viscous sublayer, suggesting a dynamical importance of this spacing.\n",
    "- **Streamwise Length**: The minimal streamwise length required for sustaining turbulence is about 250-350 in wall units ($\\lambda_x^+$), close to observed spacings of vortical structures in wall regions.\n",
    "- **Sample Statistics**: The paper presents statistics of the minimal turbulent channel, including mean velocity profiles and Reynolds shear stress, showing good agreement with standard laws for turbulent channel flow in the near-wall region. \n",
    "- **One-sided Turbulent Channel Flow**: The authors observe and detail a state where turbulence exists only near one wall, with the flow near the other wall being nearly two-dimensional and less turbulent. This state, predominant at lower Reynolds numbers or minimal box spans, *showcases the independence of turbulence mechanisms on each wall*.\n",
    "- **Wall Stresses**: They also discuss the agreement of their simulations with Dean's empirical correlation between wall skin friction and bulk velocity, further validating the minimal channel as a model for studying wall turbulence. *Figure 17, there is a link between $Re_{\\tau}$ and $Re$.*\n",

    "#### Critical Span in \"Minimal Domain Scaling\"\n",
    "The critical spanwise width ($\\lambda_z^+$) for the computational box that can sustain turbulence is found to be around 100 wall units. This dimension aligns with experimental observations of mean streak spacing in the viscous sublayer. From a physical perspective, this critical span suggests that the dynamics of wall turbulence are intimately tied to the spacing between low-velocity streaks near the wall. It underscores the importance of this spatial scale in the self-sustaining process of wall turbulence, indicating that the minimal turbulent structures necessary for sustaining turbulence are of a size comparable to this critical span. The dynamical importance of this finding is that it bridges a gap between statistical observations in experiments and the underlying flow physics, highlighting the streak spacing not just as a recurrent pattern but as an essential feature of near-wall turbulence dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision on \"Sample Statistics\"\n",
    "- **Mean Streamwise Velocity Profiles**: Figures 7 and 8 showcase the mean streamwise velocity profiles near the wall. Figure 7, specifically, presents velocity profiles for Reynolds numbers 3000 and 5000, comparing them against the standard logarithmic law of wall turbulence. It demonstrates that the flow in the minimal channel adheres well to known turbulent boundary layer behaviors in the near-wall region, particularly at lower Reynolds numbers.\n",
    "- **Reynolds Shear Stress**: Figure 8 displays the normalized Reynolds shear stress profiles, illustrating how the flow achieves a statistically steady state. This figure indicates that the simulated turbulence captures essential features of the wall-bounded shear flows, consistent with experimental findings.\n",
    "- **Root-Mean-Square Velocity Fluctuations**: Figure 9 compares the root-mean-square velocity fluctuations in the minimal channel with experimental values from Wei & Willmarth (1989). This comparison further validates the minimal channel model by showing a good match with experimental data, especially near the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Details on \"One-sided Turbulent Channel Flow\"\n",
    "The observation of one-sided turbulent channel flow represents a state where turbulence is maintained only near one wall, while the flow near the opposite wall remains nearly two-dimensional and less turbulent. This phenomenon is most pronounced at lower Reynolds numbers or when the spanwise width of the computational box approaches its minimal value. The transition to this state involves the following dynamics:\n",
    "- **Initial Conditions**: The flow begins with turbulence potentially present on both walls or initiated from a state closer to turbulence on one wall.\n",
    "- **Development**: Over time, turbulence decays on one of the walls, leading to a state where active turbulence is observed on only one side. This transition underscores the independence of turbulence mechanisms on each wall.\n",
    "- **Intermittency and Regeneration**: Even in this one-sided turbulent state, the flow near the turbulent wall exhibits characteristics of intermittent turbulence, including bursts of activity that are crucial for the regeneration of turbulence.\n",
    "- **Switching**: Remarkably, the turbulence can spontaneously switch from one wall to the other, a process that may involve complex interactions between the flow structures near each wall and the core flow. This switching further highlights the dynamic nature of near-wall turbulence and suggests a form of bistability in the flow, where two stable states (turbulence near either wall) are possible under similar flow conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This one-sided turbulence phenomenon highlights the robustness of the turbulence regeneration mechanisms and suggests a significant degree of autonomy of the near-wall turbulence from the outer flow, especially in minimal domain configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "The minimal flow unit concept provides a significantly simplified model for studying the mechanics of wall-bounded flows and testing turbulence control strategies. This simplification retains the essential features of near-wall turbulence, particularly the low-order statistical quantities, within a minimal spatial domain. The findings suggest that the basic dynamics of wall turbulence are confined to a relatively small region, challenging previous understandings and highlighting the minimal channel as a promising \"laboratory\" for further investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation:\n",
    "- The spanwise and streamwise lengths of the computational box are determined based on the requirements that the flow remains turbulent, stochastic, and three-dimensional.\n",
    "- The critical spanwise width ($\\lambda_z^+$) for sustaining turbulence is identified to be around 100 wall units, which correlates with the experimentally observed mean streak spacing.\n",
    "- Streamwise length ($\\lambda_x^+$) considerations point to a minimal period of about 250-350 wall units, indicating a lower bound for the length of eddies significant for near-wall turbulence dynamics.\n"
