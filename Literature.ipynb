    "### What is Reynolds Stress ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reynolds stress ($\\tau_{ij}$) is a fundamental concept in fluid mechanics, particularly in the study of turbulent flows. It represents the statistical average of the fluctuating component of the momentum transport caused by turbulent velocity fluctuations within a fluid flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress is the average stress caused by fluctuations in velocity in a turbulent flow. It arises due to the interaction between turbulent eddies of different sizes, leading to variations in momentum transfer within the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reynolds Decomposition:**\n",
    "The Reynolds decomposition separates the velocity field into its mean ($\\overline{u_i}$) and fluctuating ($u_i'$) components:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_i = \\overline{u_i} + u_i'\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis for Writing Reynolds Stress:**\n",
    "- The Reynolds decomposition assumes that the flow variables can be decomposed into a mean part and a fluctuating part.\n",
    "- The Reynolds stress tensor $\\tau_{ij}$ is defined as the average of the product of the fluctuating velocities $u_i'$ and $u_j'$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau_{ij} = \\overline{u_i' u_j'}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress has both normal and shear stress components, representing momentum transfer in different directions within the flow. \n",
    "- The normal stress components represent momentum transfer perpendicular to the flow direction.\n",
    "- The shear stress components represent momentum transfer parallel to the flow direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress is crucial for understanding turbulence dynamics and predicting turbulent flow behavior in various engineering and scientific applications. It influences the overall momentum transfer, heat transfer, and mixing processes within turbulent flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement:**\n",
    "Reynolds stress can be measured experimentally using various techniques such as hot-wire anemometry, particle image velocimetry (PIV), and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). These experimental methods allow researchers to quantify the magnitude and distribution of Reynolds stress in turbulent flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling:**\n",
    "In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, Reynolds stress is often modeled using turbulence models such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations or large eddy simulation (LES) models. These models aim to predict the behavior of turbulent flows by simulating the statistical characteristics of Reynolds stress.\n"

    "## History of the statistical properties of the Reynolds stresses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beginning p. 101\n",
    "The study of the statistical properties of the Reynolds stresses began in the late 1960s, with the observation by Kline et al. (1967) that the near-wall low-velocity streaks undergo a process of lift-up, oscillation, break-up and ejection, which they called bursting. Kim, Kline & Reynolds (1971) showed that most of the turbulence production in the near-wall region occurs during those bursts, and several conditional- sampling techniques were developed to identify the structures involved in the process. Examples are the u-level detection of Lu & Willmarth (1973), the VITA (variable- interval time average) of Blackwelder & Kaplan (1976) and the VISA (variable- interval space average) of Kim (1985). Several of those techniques were surveyed by Bogard & Tiederman (1986), who concluded that the best compromise between detection probability and false positives was provided by the quadrant analysis of Wallace, Eckelman & Brodkey (1972), Willmarth & Lu (1972) and Lu & Willmarth (1973), in which points of the flow are classified in terms of the quadrant of the parameter plane of streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations. Q1 events (outward interactions) have u > 0 and v > 0, Q2 events (ejections) have u < 0 and v > 0, Q3 events (inward interactions) have u < 0 and v < 0 and Q4 events (sweeps) have u > 0 and v < 0. Hereafter, Q events will be referred to simply as Qs, and we will occasionally group the ‘gradient’ Q2s and Q4s as Q−, and the ‘counter-gradient’ Q1s and Q3s as Q+.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After p. 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Although most of the early work focused on bursting in the buffer region, studies during the 1990s began to establish a relationship between near-wall bursting and outer structures. Antonia, Bisset & Browne (1990) applied a variant of the u-level method (WAG, window average gradient) to boundary layers with relatively high Reynolds numbers based on the momentum thickness, Reθ = U∞θ/ν = 1360–9630, corresponding to h+ = 530–3100. They reported that outer-scale discontinuities in the streamwise velocity, extending across the whole thickness of the boundary layer, tend to be located near the upstream end of the near-wall bursts. Wark & Nagib (1991) applied quadrant analysis to a boundary layer at Reθ = 4650 (h+ = 1500), and found large conditional events with sizes of the order of h. Using a related identification technique in the atmospheric boundary layer, Narasimha et al. (2007) described Reynolds-stress structures with lengths comparable to the distance to the wall that, because of the high Reynolds number involved, were both very long in wall units and very short compared with the boundary layer thickness. Hoyas & Jime ́nez (2006) showed that the spectral signatures of the very-large motions (Jime ́nez 1998; Kim&Adrian1999),orglobalmodes(delA ́lamoetal.2004),characteristicofthe outer region are present at the wall, as well as those of similar smaller structures in the logarithmic layer, and Hutchins & Marusic (2007b) showed that part of that influence is a modulation of the intensity of the small-scale buffer-layer fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recntly p. 102\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, Flores & Jime ́nez (2010a) showed that the hierarchy of structures of increasing sizes postulated by Townsend (1961) for the logarithmic layer can be represented numerically in computational boxes of widths proportional to the height to be studied. Each box contains a single complex structure, including a segment of a streamwise velocity streak and a cluster of vortices, that bursts quasiperiodically to fill the box with essentially normal turbulence, with a strong Q2 and Q4 occurring simultaneously. The existence of a hierarchy of Q2s and Q4s was also conjectured by Wark & Nagib (1991), and is consistent with the similarity observed by Kailas & Narasimha (1994) between the conditionally sampled structures extracted from the near-wall region of laboratory boundary layers and those in the logarithmic region of the atmospheric boundary layer.\n",
    "Q2s and Q4s play important roles in most of the structural models proposed to explain how turbulent kinetic energy and momentum are redistributed in wall-bounded turbulence. The majority of these models (see the review by Robinson 1991) are loosely based on the attached-eddy hypothesis of Townsend (1961) and involve wall- attached vortical loops growing from the wall into the outer region (Perry, Henbest & Chong 1986). More recently, in order to account for the very large-scale motions mentioned above, as well as for earlier experimental evidence on the internal structure of the bursts (Bogard & Tiederman 1986), a variant model has evolved to include vortex packets (Adrian, Meinhart & Tomkins 2000), in which trains of hairpin vortices grow from the wall by a process of merging (Tomkins & Adrian 2003) and self- regeneration (Zhou et al. 1999). The heads of the hairpins are arranged into inclined shear layers generated by the combined induction of the hairpins of the packet, with a Q4 upstream and above the packet and a Q2 beneath it. Ganapathisubramani, Longmire & Marusic (2003) used PIV data on wall-parallel planes in a boundary layer with Reθ = 2500 (h+ = 1060) to quantify the contribution to the Reynolds stresses by packets of hairpins. They report that, at y+ = 100, packets covering 4 % of the area produce 28 % of the total Reynolds stresses.\n",
    "The hairpin-packet model is usually understood to involve relatively smooth vortex loops as the structures associated with Townsend’s (1976) attached eddies, although recent discussions tend to include ‘canes, heads, legs and three-quarter hairpin shapes, generally asymmetric and distorted’ into the class of ‘hairpin-like’ vortices (Dennis & Nickels 2011a), making them hard to distinguish from generic vortices. An alternative,lessorganized,structurewasproposedbydelA ́lamoetal.(2006),who analysed the statistical properties of clusters of vortices (clusters hereafter) in direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of turbulent channels with h+ = 550–1880. The clusters segregate into wall-attached and wall-detached families. The wall-detached clusters are dissipative objects, with sizes that scale with the local Kolmogorov scale. The attached ones form a self-similar family of objects that mark strong Q2s. The averaged flow conditioned to an attached cluster consist on an elongated low-velocity streak extending downstream of the cluster, flanked by a pair of shorter high-velocity streaks. While this averaged structure is consistent with the hairpin packet paradigm, del A ́lamoetal.(2006)pointedoutthattheinstantaneousclustersaremorecomplex,in agreement with earlier visualizations by Tanahashi et al. (2004).\n",

    "Note that the threshold in (2.1) depends on the wall distance. As noted by Nagasoa & Handler (2003), using an identification method with a constant threshold, such as |τ| > Hu′(y0)v′(y0), with some reference y0, is problematic in inhomogeneous flows. In our case, very few objects are recovered in the outer region if y0 is chosen in the buffer layer, while choosing a high y0 results in a confusingly cluttered buffer layer. This behaviour agrees with the observations of Blackburn, Mansour & Cantwell (1996) and worsens as Re increases. Our choice of the local standard deviation in (2.1) results in a roughly constant ́contribution of the Qs to the Reynolds stress and agrees with a similar choice in del Alamo et al. (2006) for the identification of vortex clusters.\n",
    "As argued by Bogard & Tiederman (1986), quadrant analysis depends on the value of the hyperbolic-hole size H. They report that the optimum threshold for the buffer region is H ≈ 1, based on direct comparisons between the detected events and instantaneous visualizations of the flow. We choose H based on the percolation behaviour of (2.1). Percolation theory describes the statistics of the connected components of a random graph. Here, it is applied to the variation with H of the volume of the connected objects extracted by (2.1), as first used to identify vorticity and dissipation structures in isotropic turbulence by Moisy & Jime ́nez (2004) and in channelsbydelA ́lamoetal.(2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1(a) shows the percolation diagram of (2.1) in the two channels considered here. The solid lines are the ratio of the volume of the largest identified object, Vlar, to the total volume Vtot satisfying (2.1), and the dashed ones are the total number of identified objects, N/Nmax , normalized with its maximum over H. When H & 3, the identification only yields a few small objects that correspond to the strongest Qs. Decreasing H introduces new Qs, while previously identified ones grow in size. At first, the size of the largest Q changes little, and Vlar/Vtot stays roughly constant, but eventually the objects start to merge, resulting in a rapid increase of Vlar /Vtot and in a decrease of the number of objects. Figure 1(a) shows that this percolation crisis takes place in the range 0.5 . H . 3, independently of the Reynolds number. For lower thresholds, Vlar /Vtot ≈ 1, and most of the volume satisfying (2.1) belongs to a single object."

    "- **Doubly Infinite**: This implies that the array of flow structures extends infinitely both in the streamwise $(x)$ and spanwise $(z)$ directions. In other words, if you were to move in either the $x$-direction or the $z$-direction, you would encounter identical flow structures repeating at regular intervals indefinitely.\n",

    "- **Periodic Array**: Each flow structure within this array repeats itself periodically. This means that if you were to examine the flow at any given location within the domain, you would observe the same pattern of flow structures repeating at intervals determined by the streamwise and spanwise periods.\n",

    "- **Streamwise and Spanwise Periods ($\\lambda_x$ and $\\lambda_z$)**: These represent the distances between repetitions of the flow structures in the streamwise $(x)$ and spanwise $(z)$ directions, respectively. For example, if $\\lambda_x$ is the streamwise period, it means that the flow structures repeat every $\\lambda_x$ units along the $x$-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-channel Extent $(2h)$**: This refers to the distance between the top and bottom boundaries of the computational domain in the cross-channel $(y)$ direction. The factor of 2 is included because it represents the full height of the channel, from the top wall to the bottom wall.\n",

    "### Initial Conditions\n",
    "- Started flow for each combination of $Re$ and wavelengths using fully developed flow field from nearby parameters\n",
    "- First run initiated as random finite-amplitude perturbation of parabolic flow at $Re = 7000$\n",
    "- Subsequent runs started incrementally from results of initial simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long Integration Times\n",
    "- Intrinsic timescales in flow: eddy turnover time, sublayer viscous timescale, outer flow viscous timescale\n",
    "- Additional intermediate timescale discovered during investigation\n",
    "- Required running times of 1000-3000 to establish asymptotically steady flow\n",
    "- Each time step required 0.7s on Cray Y-MP, requiring 50-100 CPU hours for sustained turbulence simulations\n",
